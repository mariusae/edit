COMMAND DOCUMENTATION

    Edit is a file finder/plumber for Acme.

    Usage:

	edit query [dirs...]

    Edit executes a query against a set of directories (default: .). If
    there is exactly one result, edit will automatically plumb the files,
    similar to Plan 9's B command.

    The EDITPATH environment variable is a colon-separated list of
    directories to look for files.

    Using the invocation:

	edit dir:query

    Edit executes the query against x/dir for every directory x in EDITPATH.

    Edit traverses each given directory, skipping common database paths
    (.git, .svn), and matches each entry against the query.

    Queries are partial paths. A query matches a candidate path when each
    path element in the query matches a path element in the candidate path.
    The elements have to appear in the same order, but not all path elements
    from the candidate path are required to match.

    A query path element matches a candidate path element if (1) it is a
    substring of the path element; or (2) it is a glob pattern (containing
    any of "*?[") that matches according to filepath.Match.

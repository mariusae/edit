go get -u marius.ae/edit


Edit is a "fuzzy" file finder/plumber for Acme.

Usage:

	edit query [dirs...]

Edit executes a query against a set of directories (default: .). If
there are two or fewer results, edit will automatically plumb the files,
similar to Plan 9's B command.

Edit traverses each given directory, skipping common database paths
(.git, .svn), and matches each entry against the query.

A candidate path is admitted if all the characters in the query appear
in the same order in the path. If the query contains the path separator
'/' then the characters in the query delimited by that separator must
appear within a single path element in the candidate path.
